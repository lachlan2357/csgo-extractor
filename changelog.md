# v0.1.1
## New
- Added terminal check to directory so the program won't run if the directory doesn't contain a csgo or cstrike15 folder
- Added an option to choose whether to overwrite previously-extracted data after extraction process

## Fixed
- Removed debug output of each skin collection name
- Added missing entry for 'setup' under the help menu
- csgo-extractor.sh is executable by default, so making it so shouldn't be required

# v0.1.0
Initial Release
